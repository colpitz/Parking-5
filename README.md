# Parking-5
The project consists of 5 position sensors for five parking spaces, 
with REED switching relays, located on the ground, 
each relay turns on a green or red LED depending on whether the space is free or occupied. 
There are two barriers for passing cars, one to enter and another to exit, made with servo SG90 
Each barrier has two sensors on the ground, with simple REED relay, before and after the barrier to detect the car and 
You can press a button to let the car enter or exit and lower the barrier after passing the second sensor. 
The number of empty and occupied spaces is presented on a display of 16x2 lines of text.

# Parking-5
The project consists of 5 position sensors for five parking spaces, 
with REED switching relays, located on the ground, 
each relay turns on a green or red LED depending on whether the space is free or occupied. 
There are two barriers for passing cars, one to enter and another to exit, made with two servos SG90. 
Each barrier has two sensors on the ground, with simple open REED relay, before and after the barrier to detect the car, then
You can press a button to open barrier and let the car enter and lower the barrier after passing the second sensor, the same to exit with the car.
When all the parking spaces are occupied no more cars can enter to the parking
The number of empty and occupied spaces is presented on a display of 16x2 lines of text.
